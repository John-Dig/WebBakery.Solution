  Software for Pierre to track his Vendors and Orders.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "Bakery.Solution/Bakery".
3. In the command line, run the command "dotnet run" to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.

### Known Bugs

It should function just fine.  There are some inefficiencies in the code (unnecessary data types), and some other refactoring could be done to make it more modular and utilize more OOP that I was originally planning on doing but ran out of time.
